Ingress One Time Pad Cracker
=========

This was an effort to peform a partial known plaintext attack against the published timestamp information to determine when anomaly volaties were being measured

  - This works on most formats through the #Cassandra Anomaly
  - Padded character was a X and had between 0 and n occurances in the string up to the length (39 or 59) around the plaintext
  - Before the Paris event an assumption that there was at least 1 X between terms greatly reduced the problemspace
  - Single threaded but designed to be highly shardable.

Installation
--------------

Requires a g++ with std=c++0x or c++11 support (clang didn't support some feature I was abusing at the time)

- debugclean doesn't deleted the permutation_base object (see: notes).
- fast applies -Ofast and -march=native

```sh
make
make debugclean
make fast
./otp.bin encrypted_string md5 [options]
```

Options
-------
    [-sh start_hour=1] [-eh end_hour=start_hour]
    [-sm start_minute=0] [-em end_minute=5]
    [-ss start_second=0] [-es end_second=70] (60 is a spelling variation of fourty)
    [-m measurement=]

Notes
-----
* src/permutation_base.c
 * A horrific monstrosity partially generated by the included sum_n.py, I had some issues generating this on the fly and going much larger causes the complier to either die a horrible mess or just take forever to compile (compiling this with optimization flags will take forever, do not do this, this is why i added the `make debugclean` target.
* Included is a partial list of known formats through the #Cassandra Anomaly Series
* Some testcases are included, although mostly hasn't been updates to the newer format strings
